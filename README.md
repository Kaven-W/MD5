# MD5
This is a simple class that you can use to create MD5 hashes or to modify to make your own hashes. It is build with C#. Modify any way you want, but please leave notice to me in your file :).

I wrote the initial class, with help of [Heslacher](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/106554/md5-hash-generator) I improved my code. Suggest any improvements you wish!
